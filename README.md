# BinarySearchTree-with-Stacks
Description

This project is a C++ program designed to implement and demonstrate the use of Binary Search Trees (BSTs) in combination with Stacks. It includes operations such as inserting nodes into the BST, managing stacks at each node, and performing various operations like popping elements from the stacks or traversing the BST.

The project also explores operator overloading in C++, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of data structure implementation and object-oriented programming principles.

Features

Implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) where each node contains a stack.

Includes operator overloading for managing and manipulating stacks.

Handles robust user input and edge cases.

Outputs detailed traversal and stack operation results.

Emphasizes proper memory management and object destruction.
